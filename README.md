# QuickPush

## Installation from the repository

No need to create any virtual environments if the script only used as a CLI tool.

Install `pipx` if not done before:

```bash
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
source ~/.zshrc # or whatever shell you are using
```

In the project folder:

```bash
pipx install --editable .
```

Check if the tool is available:

```
quickpush
```
